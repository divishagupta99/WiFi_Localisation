The dataset included was created for a project done on Indoor Localisation using WiFi. Data was collected from scratch from the NAB-CS Building of KK.Birla BITS Pilani, Goa Campus.</br> 
Three different fingerprint based approaches have been used:
<br> 1. Euclidean Distance
<br> 2. Quantile Distibution
<br> 3. Multivariate Guassian Distibution
<br> The repository includes Colab Notebooks for the above mentioned approaches.
